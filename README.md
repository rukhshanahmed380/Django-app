# Django-app
This **Django Online Store** is a simple e-commerce website where users can **browse products, add them to the cart, and place orders**. The admin can **add, update, and delete products**, while customers can create accounts, log in, and track their orders. The website is built using **Bootstrap**, making it mobile-friendly and visually appealing. A **search and filter** option helps users find products easily. The system ensures secure **user authentication**, and an optional **payment integration** can be added. Data is stored in a **database**, making the store functional and efficient.
